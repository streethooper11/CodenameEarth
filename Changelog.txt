		-Overall

- Added 'NPCDefinition' Data structure, it stores parameters for MCTS/DT decision process. Has following parameters
	- OffensiveOnly (Bool): If True, Decision Tree removes action that moves pieces forward to 'home base'.
	- AvoidSacrifice (Int): If True, Decision Tree removes action that immediately ends in piece with cost higher than 'x' getting captured.
	- UseEffects (Bool): If False, Decision Tree removes action that triggers active effect.
	- SimulationDepth (Int): MCTS Runs x number of simulated game each turn.
	- GameDepth (Int): Decision Tree considers any action taken after 'x' turn to be a 'loss'. If current turn count + cutoff is larger than x, new loss point is x + cutoff.

		* Average with resign is apparently around 40 moves, Set at default at 60. Experiment is needed to confirm this.
	- GameDepthCutoff (Int): Used by GameDepth determination.
	- Exploration (Float): Its C value to be used by UCT algorithm.
	- Temperature (Float): If its x>0, effective C value will gradually decrease over simulation runs. (Doesn't need to be implemented.)

		-Earth NPC

- Moved out MCTS/DT step to CNE_Instance.
	* Reasoning to do so was to use Earth_NPC object as state generated by MCTS, with variable n,v and depth inside.

		-CNE_Instance

- Added GetNextAiMove, MCTS, and DecisionTree function to be called by Earth_NPC.
	
- Added CurrentNPCAi (NPCDefinition) variable.
- Added CurrentTurnCount (Int) variable.


		-Bug Fixes

- Reset colored tile indicating possible move if you change piece you select.
	* Added Cleanup step in GameManager > Shared Stage on PlayerPieceClicked Custom Event.

		-Additional Report

- No abnormality was observed for move generation.
	- Yet to be tested with custom/customized piece.

		-To do?

- Add generating 'Danger Tiles', which displays tiles in which enemy can capture.
- We need to ensure that MCTS's termination occurs when their King would end up in Checkmate.
	- Also prefer to generate handler for check situation.
